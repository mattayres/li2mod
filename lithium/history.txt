v0.73
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Found the bug that caused the occasional "ED_Alloc: no free edicts." fatal
error (had to do with my removal of the monster code).  Added no_bfg option
(default is on).  Made railgun an energy type weapon (armor has less benefit
from energy weapons, the blasters were the only energy weapons).

or changed.  You can set starting/max health and ammo.  You can set how
much damage each weapon does, and its radius and speed where applicable.
See lithium.cfg for the Lithium defaults.  Use normal.cfg if you want to
run a vanilla server.  Change what you'd like.  Add "+exec x.cfg" to your
command line (replace x with lithium, normal, or a config file you created).
Note if you don't set a config file, the Lithium defaults will be used.

Best weapon chosen when picking up a new one.  Adjustments and tweaks.

v0.33
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Fixed a bug in Id's bfg code that caused the server to crash sometimes.

start with.  Health and ammo maximums raised 20%.  Improved hud with 
frags/hr, players, and your place.  Faster rockets (slightly less damange
to balance).  Obituaries based on the nature of the attack.
